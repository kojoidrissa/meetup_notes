#[PyLadies HTX Book Club](http://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-HTX/events/224794575/)

We all met at Black Hole to go through the tutorial.

I realized we might need a little more structure taking the group through the tutorial. Maybe something like:

1.  Work on the tutorial on your own b/w meetings
    2. Steps 1-9 (gets Django installed)
        3. Maybe 1-5 (Python + Code Editor), then 6-9(Python intro; Django installed)?
    3. Steps 9-12 (Deploy on PythonAnywhere)
    4. Steps 15-18
    5. Steps 19-22
