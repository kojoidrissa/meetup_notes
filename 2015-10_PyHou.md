#2015-10 PyHouston Meetup

##Walker's Whosh Lightning Talk
-  [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Whoosh/); [Intro](https://pythonhosted.org/Whoosh/intro.html); [Quickstart](https://pythonhosted.org/Whoosh/quickstart.html)

##Horatio's LT: Blind Spot Detector
-  Instead of buying a car with BSD, he wrote code to help him re-arranage his mirrors
-  [His code](https://github.com/horatio-fm/blindspot)

##Main Talk by CJ: Making Python Run Fast
-  [iPython Notebook](https://www.dropbox.com/s/owot3lu02t9qdpc/Making%20Python%20Run%20Fast.ipynb?dl=0)
-  First: make it WORK. Don't premie optimize
-  Second: TESTS! Fast, broken code is still broken
-  iPython `%timeit` for simple profiling
-  collections.defaultdict INSTEAD of testing to see if a key exists in a dictionary
    -  Or, use a Counter if you're counting
-  "Fewer characters == faster code" in Python; Builtins are faster than code YOU write
-  Compile your RegEx: `patt = re.compile(r'pattern')`

###Profiling
-  CJ likes Line Profiler, which is NOT in the StdLib; [Other profilers]](https://www.google.com/search?q=python+profiler&oq=python+profiler&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3207j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8)
    -  in iPython, `%lprun -f func_name(args)`
-  `from dis import dis`: to see the bytecode for your code.
    -  [Python dis module](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/dis.html)

###[Cython](http://cython.org/)
-  `%%cython ---annotate` in iPython
-  `cdef int`Type annotations: specifies a type, make things faster
    -  Python >= 3.4 has them for function calls
