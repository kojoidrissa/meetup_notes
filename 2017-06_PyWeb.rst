PyWeb Houston 2017-06: Intro to Machine Learning
===================================================
-  A category of AI, trying to have computers behave like humans by using statistical methods to "learn" from large bodies of data.
	-  AI --> ML --> Deep Learning
-  TPU - Tensor Processing Units: Invented by Google; 15-30x faster than CPUs and GPUs

Basic Steps
-----------
-  Get data
-  Clean/Prep data
	-  split it into Training/Validation(10%)/Testing sets
-  Train model
-  Test your model vs independent data
-  Improve/Iterate

ANN: Artificial Neural Network
-------------------------------
The "standard" NN we often think of.

CNN: Convolutional Neural Network
---------------------------------
-  Style transfer
	-  `MXNET <https://github.com/dmlc/mxnetL>`_ a deep learning library in Python

RNN: Recurring Neural Networks
-----------------------------
` The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks <https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/>`_

Reinforced Learning
--------------------
A step b/w Supervised (allthe above examples) an Unsupervised learning

Generative Adversarial Network
-------------------------------
One network gets better via attacks by another network

Python Libraries
-----------------
-  MXNET
-  PyTorch
-  Theano
-  Blocks
-  Keras
-  TensorFlow
	-  Best starting point
	-  Large community
-  scikit-learn

Web APIs
---------
-  MS Azure ML, Google ML, Amazon ML
-  IBM Watson
-  Wit.AI
-  API.AI
-  Diffbot
	-  Extract data from a web page (text/image/video content)
