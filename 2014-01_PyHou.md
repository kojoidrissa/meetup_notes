##My Presentation: The State of Python 3

##Inspiration: [About Python 3](http://alexgaynor.net/2013/dec/30/about-python-3/) by [Alex Gaynor](http://alexgaynor.net/about/)

##My Angle: Growing Python by creating new Python developers
-  But, "Which Python?!?"

<blockquote><p>I want to learn Python because it’s positioned perfectly for what I want to do. It’s a great language for Web applications with enough backbone to hold it’s own in academia. It can be optimized with C, handles data well (for my use), and has enough libraries/frameworks to get a quick prototype up.</p>

<p>I’m hesitant to invest the time into Python when I see what appears to be (at least from the outside, in) <em>a split in the community and a further split in the community from the core Python team.</em></p>
</blockquote>

##Core Problem: Slow adoption of Python 3 is creating a growing gap between 2.x and 3.x
-  "Why U No Use Python 3?!?"

###Reasons for the split
-  Is there anything in Python 3.x that you, as a Python 2.x dev want or find compelling?
-  Are there features in Python 3.x that make it, in any way, superior to Python 2.x? Inferior?
-  Are the libraries you need/want to use still not available for Python 3.x?
-  Are you lazy?

###Solutions-Oriented Development
-  For current developers
    -   Iterative Porting? Going from 2.X to 3.0, then 3.0 to 3.1, etc? Perhaps each change is a natural time to refactor?
-  For newcomers?
    -  Standard advice: Unless you have some specific need for Py 2.x, learn 3.x
    -  HOWEVER! If most of the community is using 2.x, who're you going to get help from when you run into problems?
