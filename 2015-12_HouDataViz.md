##Michelle: Design Principles/Typography
-  [Dieter Rams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams): Michelle's favorite designer
-  Typeface/familes/fonts
    +  Typeface families: Helvetica
    +  Typeface: Helvetica Italic
    +  Font: Helvetica Italic 28pt
    +  Compare [Helvetica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica) to [Arial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial): VERY similar, but not the same
        *  don't use them together because they're **too** similar, yet *NOT* the same
-  Serif vs Sans Serif argument
    +  Pro Serif
        *  horizontal "flow" guides the eye (claim)
        *  increases spacing & context
        *  good for *print* body text (claim)
    +  Pro Sans
        *  better on web (claim)
        *  better at small sizes & reproduction due to simpler form
        *  easier for kids to learn to read (claim)
-  Readability factors
    +  Point size
    +  x-height (size of the lowercase 'x' in the family)
    +  Ascenders & descenders
    +  counters (negative space...inside 'b' or 'g')
    +  tracking: spacing b/w each character
    +  kerning: space b/w each unique pair of letters
    +  Leading (led-ing): what we call 'single-space' or 'double-space'
    +  Hierarchy: Moving the eye through the page with different text sizes/weights. Similar to the way you create Hierarchy w/ HTML or semantic markup
