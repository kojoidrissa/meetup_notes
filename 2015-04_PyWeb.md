##tl;dr: Use Stripe
-  their [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/api/python#intro) are great
    +  https://stripe.com/docs/checkout
-  With Stripe, you don't have to worry about PCI compliance. They handle it for you, since you're not storing card or payment info.

##Stripe w/ Flask
-  Easiest to use
-  Only works with credit cards
-  Highest fees
-  No monthly fee

##Paypal Classic w/ Django
-  credit cards and Paypal accounts
-  makes you jump through a bunch of hoops to get your money
-  [django-paypal](https://github.com/spookylukey/django-paypal)
-  Takes user to Paypal, away from your site, while they're paying
    +  You can provide a callback URL
-  APIs
    +  Classic: django-paypal
    +  REST API: [PayPal-Python-SDK](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Python-SDK)
    +  [Braintree](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/ios+python/sdk/overview/how-it-works)
        *  Paul recommends this API

##Stripe bitcoin w/ Flask
-  Better for some international payments
-  ONly need to add one line to the Stripe script to accept Bitcoin

##When to use which option?
-  look into the different fee structures; consider optimizing based on your sales frequency and amounts
