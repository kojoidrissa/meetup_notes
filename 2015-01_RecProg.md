##General notes
- We started with a discussion of Unix [xargs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs)
    + Python has a somewhat similar construct (I could be wrong, I'll need to look into this more) known as [`*args` and `**kwargs`](https://freepythontips.wordpress.com/2013/08/04/args-and-kwargs-in-python-explained/).
- Chris' Holographic Universe started a discussion about [FFT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform), "an algorithm to compute the [discrete Fourier transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform)(DFT) and its inverse". Something else I need to learn more about, as it seems to be EVERYWHERE.
    + The idea of [Convolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) also came up.
- Later, Mark had a question about how to do something INSTEAD of using a [PID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) controller. We decided he needed general purpose AI and Hope.
- Speaking of algorithms, Chris and I announced we'd signed up for [this Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo) class on the topic.
- The blog of [Ken Perlin](http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/) was recommended, when Patrick demoed his "draw shapes and move them" software, written in Haskell. My brain was already overly tired by then, so I sadly missed out on a lot of that discussion.
- Also, [D3js](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D3.js) got mentioned, which would've made [Micah Stubbs](https://twitter.com/micahstubbs) happy. But he'd already gone home. I need to do somethign with D3js at some point as well. SO. MUCH. TO. DO.
