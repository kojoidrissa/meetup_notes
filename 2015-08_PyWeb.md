#[Securing your website with [django-secure](http://django-secure.readthedocs.org/en/stable/) by Nick Thompson](http://www.meetup.com/python-web-houston/events/223607275/)

Nick's slides are on [Github](https://github.com/NAThompson/django_https)

-  PK encryption vs. Symmetric Key encryption?
-  ECDH: Elliptic Curve [Diffe Helman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)
-  Ciphersuite
    +  Key Exchange algorithm
    +  bulk encryption algo
    +  message authentication code algo
    +  authentication protocol
-  NEVER, EVER use SSL. It's been broken for years! Use [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) instead.
-  disable ALL the weak stuff on your site!
    +  No one attacks STRONG crypto; they'll try to handshake to weak encryption and crack it
-  Prefer galois counter modes (AES-GCM) as they consume less resources
-  Prefer SHA256 over SHA1, as it will be depricated
-  Prefer elliptic curve crypto

##Common Attacks
-  Defend against Logjam Attack

##DH Key exchange review
-  Modular exponentiation is fast
-  The secret "A" stays in RAM and is discarded when the process is done.

##Primality testing
-  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test
    +  If it takes 2 minutes to generate a prime, EVERYONE uses the same prime.
    +  SO, generate a HUGE Diffe Hillman prime (4096)

##HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
-  protocol that forces ALL traffic over https.
-  It's an option in [django-secure](http://django-secure.readthedocs.org/en/stable/)

##Encrypt your site!!
-  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_injection

##Public Key Pinning
-  Tells your browser to REMEMBER and trust the FIRST public key it gets

##Links to keep
-  [SSL Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html)
    +  The results for [kojoidrissa.com](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=kojoidrissa.com&hideResults=on) were confusing and NOT encouraging. :-(
-  Paul said SOMETHING about [Cloudflare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CloudFlare), but it seemed like a diss, overall.
-  Not a strict security thing, but Django folks seem to LOVE some [nginx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx)
    +  Here's their [Beginner's Guide](http://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html)!
-  [OCSP stapling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling): no idea.
