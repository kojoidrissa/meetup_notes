#Houston Open Developers Plans

##Overall plans
Open to ALL sorts of programming. Looking at practical ways to use programming to solve problems in a variety of ways.

I'd also like to help people who **aren't**/don't think they **can be** programmers, *become* programmers. The emphasis would be on helping people solve their day-to-day problems through programming. 

##General idea (based on the people I know)
-  Aarron: Secure coding; risks of security in SAAS apps
-  Wes: Functional programming - Why/What/How
-  Linda: iOS programming
-  Ming: Machine Learning
-  Kevin: AYU
-  Ben: Linux/Arduino/RaspPi
-  bash or shell programing
-  Developing with/on a Raspberry Pi
    -  General dev tools
    -  Building various single-purpose computers with a RasPi
-  Data Science; Data Analysis; Data Viz
-  Programming for Non-Programmers

##February
Automating Libre/OpenOffice.org

##Surveys/polls

###What type of developer are you (select as many as apply)
-  Professional developer (it's how I pay the bills)
-  Aspiring pro devloper (it's how I'd LIKE to pay the bills, but not yet)
-  Hobbyist/Intro/Curious (I have no actual NEED to develop, but I do anyway...but I'm kind of new/basic)
-  Hobbyist-Pro (I don't HAVE to write code, but I've been doing it for quite a while and could probably get paid for it)
-  Web (mostly web-stuff; front or back-end)
-  non-Web (mostly non-web stuff)
-  Other (none of your options fit me!)

###What languages do you use most (or want to learn)?

###What platforms do you develop on?
-  WIndows
-  OS X
-  \*nix
-  Other

##March
-  Canceled

##April
-  Intro to Version Control with Git
    -  Blurb
        +  Version control is essential for large-scale development.  However it also has great benefits for new programmers. It's also useful for web developers of all types, whether you do basic HTML/CSS by hand or use a large framework like Drupal/Django/Wordpress.
        +  We'll look at the basic concepts of the Git version control system and how it can help developers of all types and at every level. Even beginners!
