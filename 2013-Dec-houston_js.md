#[Dragons and Embers - a tale of JS Frameworks](http://www.meetup.com/houston-js/events/154962792)

##Ember (used by Molecule Software)
-  Testing was hard, but now it's easier with ember-testing
-  No 'gems', limited third party libs
-  Hard to integrate with existing stuff (even though it's built on jQuery, doesn't always play well with other jQuery stuff)

##Codename: Dragon (Kiyu from 2nd.MD)
###Why build your own?
-  What need are you filling
-  Clear vison of "why" more important than "what"

###Who?
WHo's gonna build and maintain it?

###WHen?
What's your time budget?

###How
1. Pick an AWESOME name!!
No, really
-  servers
-  language(s)
-  lib(s)
-  database(s)
-  test framework(s) & runnner(s)
-  doc generator(s)
-  3rd party services
-  hosting (*aaS*) providers

###Stylez
-  req-response
-  AJAX?
-  sockets?

##Dragon
-  Borrowed heavily from [pedestal.io](http://pedestal.io/)
-  Didn't want Clojure...yet
-  wanted sockets
-  wanted Angular
-  Wanted a data flow & functional style
-  Isomorphic JavaScript

###Why functional programming?
Functional programming has delivered better ont he promise of code resue than ObjOr for Kiyu...and others in the audience.

All of their JavaScript is actually CoffeeScript.

Uses [bacon.js](http://baconjs.blogspot.com/): "[FRP (functional reactive programming) library for Javascript](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js)". I don't REALLY know what that means.
